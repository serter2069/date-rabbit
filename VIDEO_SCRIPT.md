# DateRabbit - Video Script

## Step 1: Problem
**Voice-over:** How many times have you wasted time on pointless dates with the wrong people?

**Scene:** A young woman sits in a cheap diner with outdated decor and a run-down atmosphere. Across from her sits an unkempt man, disheveled, possibly with a belly, indifferently scrolling through his phone. Occasionally, he mutters a few words without looking at her.

She stares out the window, bored, thinking to herself: "Why did I even come here?"

The camera focuses on her sad face, while in the background, other couples in the café are laughing and enjoying their conversations.

## Step 2: Solution
**Voice-over:** DateRabbit — Get paid for your dates so you don't waste time on meeting new people.

**Scene:** A young woman is at home, sitting on a couch with her phone in hand.
- She opens the DateRabbit app. The interface looks sleek and minimalistic.
- The settings menu appears on the screen, where she selects her hourly rate — $50/hour. (Similar to TaskRabbit rate-setting interface)
- Next, she navigates to the list of requests from men, with different types and personalities.
- On-screen, each request has verification marks: "Verified: Biometrics, Personal Data, Bank Card."
- She starts scrolling through profiles, studying the candidates.
- She smiles, realizing she has full control over the process.

## Step 3: How it works
**Voice-over:** Every man undergoes a strict identity verification to ensure serious intentions and your safety.

**Scene:** A man is shown going through the registration process:
- He enters the SPU office (logo and colors resemble UPS), where an employee takes his fingerprints.
- Next, he photographs his passport and links his bank card in the app for verification.
- On his phone screen, a green checkmark appears with an animation confirming successful verification.
